*intl.txt*	Few missing i18n bits

*MAPPINGS*						       *intl-mappings*

All mappings are for |Insert-mode|. You are supposed to have |'keymap'| option
set before using them.

<C-B>       changes the language of the last |WORD| typed,
            also toggles the keymap in use |i_Ctrl-^|
<C-L>       same for the change being typed |'[|
<C-S>       same for the last |sentence| typed

<plug>lmap; This is a generic |<Plug>|-mapping. Define your own mappings using
            it in order to override the defaults above. You have to delete the
            text into unnamed register |quotequote| before calling it.
            NOTE that only single letter |language-mapping| supported!

Here is how the default mappings are defined >

  inoremap <unique><C-B> <C-\><C-O>dB<plug>lmap;
  inoremap <unique><C-L> <C-\><C-O>d`[<plug>lmap;<C-G>u
  inoremap <unique><C-S> <C-\><C-O>d(<plug>lmap;

SPELL FILE MISSING				       *intl-SpellFileMissing*

The plugin is able to download missing spell files from the net. You don't
need standard |spellfile.vim| or |netrw| plugin anymore. Both https://curl.se
and https://www.gnu.org/software/wget can be used. The variable
`g:spellfile_URL` is also supported.

GETTEXT						    *Gettext()* *intl-gettext*

There is also a small compatibility function named `Gettext()`. It calls
|gettext()| if it's available. Otherwise, it returns the argument unmodified.
